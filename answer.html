        <h2 class="text-primary my-4 py-4">ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 is a significant update to the JavaScript
            programming
            language. It is the first
            major update to the language since ES5 which was standardized in 2009. Therefore, ES2015 is often called
            ES6.</h2>

                <p><span class="fw-bold">Var:</span> The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It
                    means variables defined outside
                    the
                    function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be
                    accessed within the function. <span class="fw-bold">Let:</span> The scope of a let variable is only
                    block scoped. It canâ€™t be
                    accessible outside the particular block ({block}). <span class="fw-bold">Const:</span> The const
                    keyword has all the properties
                    that are
                    the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.</p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">What is the difference between arrow function and normal function?</h3>
                <p>Arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more
                    concise syntax for writing function expressions. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not
                    have their own this.Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or
                    non-strict mode but Regular function can have.</p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">What is the difference between template string and normal string?</h3>
                <p>The big difference between a template literal and a regular string is substitutions. Before ES6, we
                    have to
                    use the technique to create a multi-line string by manually including the newline
                    character ( \n) but now we can easily write multilines with template string. We can easily make
                    dynamic string by using template string writing the value inside ${}.</p>

                <p>Map function used for loop through the array and make new array with matched items by transforming
                    every element in an array individually. ForEach function
                    used for loop through the array but it doesnot return any value. Filter Function filter creates a
                    new array by removing elements that don't belong to the condition. Find function loop through an
                    array and only return first match item.</p>
